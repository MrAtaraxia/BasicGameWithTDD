    BasicGameWithTDD
- [x] Pytest things:
    - [x] Get basic fixtures working for pytest.
- [x] Game Mechanics:
    - [x] Implement a basic player class.
    - [x] Implement a basic card class.
    - [x] Implement a basic game class.
    - [x] Add the general cards to the game.
    - [x] Implement all card movements for a player.
      - [X] Have them properly interact with the board.
      - I think this is done.
      But, in doing this I realized that... all of my cards that are associated with the player are 
        inside lists themselves while the cards on the board are not. This will probably upset me later!
   - [ ] Have the game properly label where things are?
     - [ ] AKA which cards are in where?
    - [ ] Implement displaying the players.
      - How do I want to do this?
    - [ ] Implement displaying the board.
      - How do I want to do this?
    - [ ] Implement the set up of the game.
      - [ ] Implement things that require comparison of number of players. ex Curse count.
      - Basic goal, get the game to a point where it is 'starting'.
    - [ ] Implement player turns.
      - [ ] Implement the parts of the turn.
        - [ ] Implement the Action Phase.
        - [ ] Implement the Buy Phase.
    - [ ] Import the cards from a json. (I think it will be easier to modify it then.)
    - [ ] Implement Attack cards...
      - [ ] Player interaction might be annoying. we will see.
      
    - [ ] Implement all the card actions.
      - [ ] This will take a WHILE!
    - [ ] Implement it so it is no longer hot seat! Network it!
      - [ ] THIS WILL TAKE A LOOOONG while!
      - [ ] I should probably be able to go off of my other ones from before.
      - [ ] Might I want to modify LoveLetter first?
      
    - [ ] Other
    - [ ] Creating a basic text version of dominion.

- Basically this is probably going to be a long todo list or something of that nature.
- At least until I figure out a better thing to do with this.
