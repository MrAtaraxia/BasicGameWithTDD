A Basic setup for testing BasicGame.py

2020.01.28 - I think this is coming along nicely.
It has only been 2 days, I think.
I almost have it all set to actually be at the 'start of game' condition.
I do like doing TDD!
I don't know the whole "do it with someone else" mentality though.
I will have to look into that more.

2020.02.04 - Currently I have added all return typing.
THAT took a bit because of the annoyances of Lists and the requirement for Union for them.
I have added a basic log to this as well.
It is not everywhere yet but I will work on putting it in more places.
Yep
I might also want to add time to that to see WHEN certain things happened.
But we will see how THAT goes.
ALSO I did modify things to adjust how the DECKS were setup
The reason for the adjustment was I noticed that Trash, which starts empty didn't function
the same way as the others, gave an error, because it was empty.
So I could have just fixed trash, BUT then when those piles were emptied it would cause issues.
SO instead I made it so it references a 'default' card that is in [0] now and the ones that are
actually given out are in [1] instead. ALSO it has the 'default' size in [0] as well.
They are MOSTLY static, BUT they are getting eval 'd as they go in so they CAN be calculated
at runtime!!! I liked that one. It IS causing different issues, the method that imports
KEEPS telling me it wants to be made a STATIC method because there is no self in it
BUT the methods that are getting eval 'd DO have self's defined, for the player count
SO it is not liking that.
I THINK I getting close to a version of this that actually RUNS...

I want to look into what makes a 'good' prototype.

So I want to implement Log more
I want to implement the ACTUAL start of the game loop?
- Which will require the content of what I want displayed for each loop...
- That will take a bit.
- Mostly to figure out how I want that whole thing organized.
- Or do I just want to make it another function like I have for my current displays?
So I can do it THEN implement it?

I am soon getting to the point where, if I was GOOD at GUI things, it would be easier to do in a GUI.

I can't tell if I just find, my current method of using TDD or starting with backend or whatever,
BUt I find doing this, relaxing and fun.

Compared to when I started from the front end last time, without TDD... ... yeah that was painful
IT WAS satisfying to actually get things working, but it was PAINFUL to get them to that point though.

I will have to see how I am able to COMBINE, hopefully, these 2 together at SOME point
to make it so this has a GUI... HOPEFULLY I will figure out a BETTER way to do front end.

OH and based on what I read before, about how being pretty makes things more intuitive or whatever...
I think there can be pretty things that are NOT intuitive as well.
Pretty but doesn't do ANYTHING like what you want it to do.
I will need to look into that more, to see if it was more about streamlining things
removing all the things that are interesting but not normally USEFUL.
or whatever.

Its pretty, it doesn't do anything but it's pretty.
vs
It does something, no the prettiest but it gets something done.

OH I should probably setup more tomatoes as well.
I keep forgetting to tomato this...
yeah...
I need to actually TRY for a WEEK, ONLY work during tomatoes
Or NEED to have a desired number of tomatoes done at the end of the week.

How will I want to enforce that? IDK...


2021.02.06 So
Current situation is that I broke graveyard.
I broke it because it SHOULD allow the player to decide afterwards how they want to organize things
but I forgot to fix that in different places.
SO that is what I will work on first.
We will ALSO see if gitting actually works on the hour change.
Let us see...

And I broke cleanup...
yeah.
because in an ACTUAL clean up
you would discard your hand and draw new cards.
SO yes that IS correct.

added attributes draw_size and hand_limit to Player
so I can have better control over how much they draw / if they draw too much.

# help()
# DONE - For this game, I could probably use a dict...
# DONE - But if I want to keep track of order in general
#  for the draw pile on the game board I would probably
#  want to keep it as an array.
# I USED A DICT of arrays!!! I think it will work out nicely. or at least I hope so.

# Done - Add a take turn method to the game. (might need more players first)
# Well it is an 'active player' method but yeah. It rotates at least!
# DONE Add 10 selected decks.
# TODO - Finish setting up the beginning of the game:
#  reverse the players and cards... yeah I probably should.
#  Add more players.
#  Make card count for certain cards vary depending on players like it is supposed to.
#  (ex Curses is (Players -1) * 10 and VP cards are different for lower counts.)
#  Add dealing original cards to players?
# TODO - Setup the players having actions on their turns.
#  Make the turns go in turn order.
#  Make each turn have the correct phases (Actions / Buy / Cleanup)
#  Figure out what I want to do about the other parts other sets added.
# TODO - Add card actions!
#  THIS will take a LONG time. I think.
#  Mostly because I think I will have issues with edge cases causing me problems.
# TODO - What does it need to be able to set up a game?
# TODO - What else?
#  Add ability to select the 10 cards. (probably a lot later!)
#  Add ability to select the sets to play from (A LOT LATER)
# TODO - Add Graphics (FAR FAR FAR in the future! Once working from cmd line!)
# TODO - Look up how to move around better with the mouse in
# TODO - Pycharm
# TODO - AND Bash Shell. How to move up and down especially. Shift PgUp/Down but less
# TODO -
# TODO - OK for future, I MIGHT try and do it as followed:
# TODO - Make the (Game) and make it so it is setup as it starts.
# TODO - THEN do all the other things, like players AFTERWARDS!
# I have a lot of cleaning up to do later... yeah... BUT I will get more important things
